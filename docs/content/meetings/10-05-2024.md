synthesize unknown features for models to understand

follow up with Mishra about "machine-faithful"

accessibility:

- [ ] tooltip
- [ ] waria
- [ ] keyboard nav (modal editor)
  - [ ] search: cmd + K

Determine how to use tonality, different ways it can be expressed.

- suggestion on authors' style
- frequency of word choices:
  - business: formal jargon
  - writers: (personal => emotions) (academic => theoretical work)

Protocol: on-top of files.

- apple cloudkit: https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/
- personal computing paradigm: view on local files.
- editing -> users files
- not uploading => opening a file

### problems.

- increase efficiency
- if this engineer is given the tasks to utilize these models => (interface) they would build?
- AR models: compression of our understanding through text => (reason): it acts as if it is an assistant
- we don't do rewrite

machine-faithful: alignment issues

data poisioning during pre-training (we can't control this) <-- Llama 3.2
features ablation

### stakeholders.

creative writing <- professional doesn't care

Users: someone that doesn't defined themselves as writers.

- writers are for their own interfaces and rules (no AI)
- writers block

  - ideas curations
  - defend their arguments
  - inspirations (resources) <-- Search

- engineers
  - who writes
  - language game / how to structure sentences

students: <- pedagaogical implications (editor to help users to write essays? Probably not) <-- no

> [!important] Crucial
> We don't rewrite text (synthesize based on users past essays) <-- tinymorph
