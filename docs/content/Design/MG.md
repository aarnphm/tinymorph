## Purpose

The following encapsulates both system and document purposes for [[/index|tinymorph]]

### System Purpose

The system is a web-based text editor designed to inspire creativity and make the writing process smoother and more enjoyable. It helps users explore their ideas in a non-linear way, offering interactive suggestions powered by advanced machine learning.
With features like text steering, feedback, and note-style suggestions, the system gives writers the flexibility to refine their tone and structure while keeping full control over their work. Everything is stored locally on the user's computer, so there's no need for logins or worrying about data privacy.
Whether you are working on creative writing or structured documents, the system provides tools to plan, brainstorm, and fine-tune ideas. It's accessible through any modern web browser, ensuring a seamless experience without the hassle of installation or compatibility issues.

### Document Purpose

The purpose of this document is to illustrate and justify the decomposition of the tinymorph system into its core components and provide a Modular Guide for each module.
This document will serve as a guide for the implementation of the system, ensuring all components are designed to achieve the system's goals effectively and maintain scalability, modularity, and user-friendliness.
This document will also serve as a basis for the implementation work scheduled to be completed in the coming months.

## Introduction

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing software. A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming team [@10.1145/361598.361623]. We advocate a decomposition based on the principle of information hiding [@10.1145/361598.361623]. This principle supports design for change, because the "secrets" that each module hides represent likely future changes. Design for change is valuable in SC,... where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the solution space is explored.

Our design follows the rules layed out by [@10.5555/800054.801999], as follows:

- System details that are likely to change independently should be the secrets of separate modules.
- Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
- Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements Specification ([[SRS/SRS|SRS]]), the Module Guide (MG) is developed [@10.5555/800054.801999]. The MG specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software. The potential readers of this document are as follows:

- New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the relevant modules they are searching for.
- Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document after changes have been made.
- Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the decomposition, and flexibility of the design.

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section [[Design/MG#Anticipated and Unlikely Changes|3]] lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software requirements. Section [[Design/MG#Module Decomposition|4]] summarizes the module decomposition that was constructed according to the likely changes. Section [[Design/MG#Connection Between Requirements and Design|5]] specifies the connections between the software requirements and the modules. Section [[Design/MG#Module Decomposition|6]] gives a detailed description of the modules. Section [[Design/MG#Traceability Matrix|7]] includes two traceability matrices. One checks the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section [[Design/MG#Use Hierarchy Between Modules|8]] describes the use relation between modules.

## Anticipated and Unlikely Changes

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness of the change, the possible changes are classified into two categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section 2.1, and unlikely changes are listed in Section 2.2.

### Anticipated Changes

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach adapted here is called design for change.

- **AC1**: Integrating with newer language models, such as Llama 3.
- **AC2**: Add support for specific GPU drivers to improve performance.
- **AC3**: Add more customization options like themes, font styles, or hotkeys.
- **AC4**: Show user progress metrics as graphs or charts.
- **AC5**: Add UI interactive features like collapsible sections, sticky notes, and inline comments.
- **AC6**: Add visual indicators for text quality metrics (e.g., grammar or tone).
- **AC7**: Enable exporting user data for backup purposes.
- **AC8**: Add tools to compare progress across multiple documents.
- **AC9**: Use A100 GPU for rendering visualizations and running text generation faster.
- **AC10**: May not integrate application with Notion and Obsidian. 
- **AC11**: Add tools to compare progress across multiple documents.


### Unlikely Changes

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these decisions will be changed.

- **UC1:**: Core editor interface will stay the same.
- **UC2**: Maintain real-time updates and context-sensitive suggestions as core features.
- **UC3**: No downloads or desktop-only application; the system must stay fully web-based.
- **UC4**: No removal of interactive elements like notes, real-time suggestions, or graph visualizations, which are central to the application.

## Module Hierarchy

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table 1. The modules listed below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will actually be implemented.

## Connection Between Requirements and Design

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection between requirements and modules is listed in Table 2.

## Module Decomposition

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of "information hiding" proposed by [@10.5555/800054.801999]. The _Secrets_ field in a module decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the module. The _Services_ field specifies _what_ the module will do without documenting _how_ to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the implementing software is given under the _Implemented By_ title. If the entry is _OS_, this means that the module is provided by the operating system or by standard programming language libraries. [/index|Tinymorph] means the module will be implemented by the [/index|tinymorph] software. Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (_--_) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented.

## Use Hierarchy Between Modules

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is provided. [@10.5555/800054.801999] said of two programs A and B that A _uses_ B if correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in its specification. That is, A _uses_ B if there exist situations in which the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct implementation of B. Figure 1 illustrates the use relation between the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler because they use modules from the lower levels.
